# Timer-in-C
I did a Timer in C as practice, just starting learning!

I just started learning programming, there's a long way to go but I know this will be a fun journey. I started
with C because we are just learning the basics at College. After i get a bit of a grisp of it, I will start learning other languages
as well a Programmation Logic itself!
